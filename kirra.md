# Kirra

## Description

Kirra is a friendly, well-behaved, low-activity dog. She is a three-year-old medium-sized labrador mix who is mature, calm and easy-going. We have had Kirra since she was three months old, and she is a cherished member of our family. If you have any questions about our dog, please don't hesitate to ask.

## Training

As experienced dog owners, we are firm believers that dogs need to be trained in order to be fulfilled and happy in a human world.
Kirra attended puppy preschool classes at Hornsby Veterinary Hospital (and won a prize for her tricks!).
She has also been socialised at dog parks since she was five months old.
She's easygoing, relaxed, and gets along with young children and other animals.

She rarely barks, preferring to let her tail do the talking.

## Exercise

Kirra enjoys trips to the dog park, so we'll be exploring the off-leash dog parks in the area - Epping Oval, Lyne Road Reserve, and Ron Payne Park.
We also make use of a dog walker's services, so she gets enough exercise through the week when we're at work.

Kirra is great on and off the leash. She goes wild at the beach - something about the sun and the sand turns her into a puppy again - and as long as she has a nice kennel to "hide" in, she's content to spend long lazy days sniffing the scents of the neighbourhood.

## Health

As a shelter rescue dog, Kirra is desexed. We keep up to date with regular vaccinations, flea/tick preventatives, and heartworm preventatives.
Her vet in Pennant Hills Veterinary Hospital is experienced, competent and professional.
To date, she's never had any ticks or fleas.

## Tidiness

Kirra doesn't cause much mess -- though she loves to tear up cardboard boxes!
She's a short-haired dog and easy to groom. She doesn't drool (thankfully!), and she's fully toilet-trained.
Kirra is covered by our home and contents insurance in the unlikely event that she could cause property damage.

## Meeting Kirra
We would be happy for a potential landlord to meet Orni, visit him in his current home, and/or check in to see how he is adjusting to his new surroundings after we move in.
Thanks for your consideration!
