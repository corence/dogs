# Orni

## Description
Orni is a friendly, affectionate, intelligent little dog who lives life guided by his nose! He is a four-year-old Daschund and he moved in with us two years ago.

## Training
Orni enjoys training as it exercises his mind. For Orni, training is a game -- one that he's talented at.
Orni quickly learns new commands, and competes with Kirra to be the best at them!
He quickly responds to voice commands when off the leash.
We love showing him new tricks!

## Health
Orni is kept up to date with preventative medications. He's healthy and full of life.
He has short, glossy fur - very easy to groom - and he doesn't make a mess.

## Exercise
We have found that Orni works well with a quick walk each evening -- as a Daschund, he needs the mental stimulation of "keeping up" with the scents and smells in the neighbourhood.
On the leash, he's constantly running -- so, when he gets home from a walk, he's usually going straight to sleep!
At home, he likes to sit and chill out -- but his nose is always twitching, seeking scents.
