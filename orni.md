# Orni

## Description
Orni is an affectionate, intelligent dog who loves the outdoors. He is a four-year-old Daschund, born in Venezuela. Orni moved in with us two years ago.

## Training
Orni has been a delight to train -- he's intelligent and eager to please.
He does not bark excessively, although he will give a short warning bark to alert us to strangers.
Orni responds well to voice commands, even when excited. Of course, his voice commands are a mix between English and Spanish!

## Exercise
We have found that Orni works well with a quick walk each evening -- as a Daschund, he needs the mental stimulation of "keeping up" with the scents and smells in the neighbourhood.

On the leash, he's constantly running -- so, when he gets home from a walk, he's usually going straight to sleep!

## Health/Grooming
As we brought Orni from Venezuela, we've made sure to take all of the necessary precautions.
He has been certified free of rabies and heartworm.
Of course, we keep up to date with his vaccinations, heartworm prevention and flea/tick prevention.
He has short, glossy fur - very easy to groom - and he doesn't drool or make a mess.

## Meeting Orni
We would be happy for a potential landlord to meet Orni, visit him in his current home, and/or check in to see how he is adjusting to his new surroundings after we move in.
Thanks for your consideration!
