# Orni

## Description
Orni is a friendly, affectionate, intelligent little dog who lives life guided by his nose! He is a four-year-old Daschund and he moved in with us two years ago.

## Training
Orni enjoys training as it exercises his mind. To him, training is a game -- one that he's talented at.
Orni quickly learns new commands, and competes with Kirra to be the best at them!
He quickly responds to voice commands when off the leash.
He does not bark excessively, although he will give a short warning bark to alert us to strangers.

## Exercise
We have found that Orni works well with a quick walk each evening -- as a Daschund, he needs the mental stimulation of "keeping up" with the scents and smells in the neighbourhood.
On the leash, he's constantly running -- so, when he gets home from a walk, he's usually going straight to sleep!

## Health
Orni is kept up to date with preventative medications. He's healthy and full of life.
He has short, glossy fur - very easy to groom - and he doesn't drool or make a mess.
